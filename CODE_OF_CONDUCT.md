# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a safe, respectful, and welcoming community.

- Be kind and inclusive. Discrimination, harassment, and personal attacks are not tolerated.
- Assume good intent and provide constructive feedback.
- Keep discussions technical and focused. Debate ideas, not people.
- Follow project maintainers' guidance and decisions.

Violations may result in warnings or removal from the community spaces at the maintainers' discretion.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers via a private channel (see SECURITY.md for contact).
